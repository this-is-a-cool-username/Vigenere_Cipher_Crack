# Vigenere_Cipher_Crack
This program is a collaborative effort to decipher variable-length strings that have been encoded using the Vigenere cipher. Strings are accepted using the English alphabet characters "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", and are presumed to be written in English (all upper case) with no punctuation or spaces.
